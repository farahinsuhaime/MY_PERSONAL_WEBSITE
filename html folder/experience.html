	<p>Hi! Since I'm 22 years old in 2022, I believe I've gained some valuable life experience! First and foremost, my trip to Korea will be an experience I will never forget! Thanks to my mother and father.Arriving in Korea was both thrilling and intimidating and it was a wonderful experience. We spent the majority of our time there dining and sight-seeing. The best thing in Korea is their food. Even if I'm not doing anything, I'm just glad to be there! It's one of the best thing that've happend in my life and it was just overall a great experience!

	<p>I never expected to be a member of an association when I started university. But, since we're conducting online distance learning right now due to the epidemic, I figured I'd join an association to fill in the gaps in my schedule. Then I applied to this organization, which is jpk, and I was accepted! I have no prior experience with associations, yet everyone I meet in the same association is quite helpful! They teach me everything I need to know, which I greatly appreciate!So, this is an experience I don't think I'll ever have again, and on top of that, I've made some new amazing friends! I believe we will always be excellent friends! This was one of the most memorable experiences of my life. &#11088 &#11088</p>
